# vinyl-finder

vinyl-finder checks every 4 hours if the vinyl records I am interested in buying are available on [Discogs](https://discogs.com/. If a test fails, it means that the vinyl is available to purchase, and GitHub will notify me by email about a broken spec. This is my signal to purchase the vinyl record. Time to buy!
